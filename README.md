<h2 align="center">About</h2>

Chillvill is a website that relaxes the mind with sound and imagery. The website is simple to navigate and can continue to work in the background while you do something on your device or browser. Here’s how it works, Chillvill will ask you for a mood choice, then it will show you some sound options according to the mood, anything from brown noise, rain, or if you would prefer some tunes that you find relaxing according to your music taste sign in to Spotify and the website will start playing something just for you (you can play whatever music you like though). Maybe you want more than one sound playing, select up to 5 sound options to play synchronously (including your choice of music). After this you can set up some relaxing imagery according to your mood, which includes anime, nature scenes, or something else that you enjoy watching on YouTube. Whatever you come up with will be displayed on the home page, where you can enjoy a timed session or just sit back and take it all in. On the home page, you can toggle on “Background play” or leave it off by default. You can edit your profile at any time as well as sign out of your Spotify, YouTube or Chillvill itself. Edit any of the home page features, “music and sound”, “Imagery and video” in the Preferences page along with the date display placement (left side, middle, right side), toggling the date display on or off, toggling a display bar for what you’re watching and listening to on or off, in the Settings section. All of these settings will be saved for you, as well as any combinations of sound and imagery, which can be saved in “Favorites”. In Preferences you can go on the Suggestions section to view more options and things to do while you enjoy Chillvill. Finally, you can contact me on the Support page if there is any trouble or questions you have for me.
